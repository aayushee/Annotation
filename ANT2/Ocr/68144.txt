IhnnK only by amendments proposed bv a
convention which Is I held hut onto In twenty
r MM Ia I wholly without foundation
Any tew provision which the people wsnt
1 tn tint into the Constitution cnn be put
there In two years If It receives the nit
I 4 proxnl of tO successive Legislatures anti
that approval 1 ratified by a popular vote
I r I The Hipublicans nsk electors t vote for
I all the amendments which arc t b sub
mitted together today on the ground that
1 there are more Rood ones than bat ones In
o the lot The truth is 1 that the presence of a
slnKlo bad measure among the others should
induce every Intelligent voter to reject them
I r I t for nny good provision can b adopted
by Itself at once by the legislature and
submitted to the people separately within
T three years at the furthest
f There is I absolutely nothing In the argu
f ment that people should vote for some
