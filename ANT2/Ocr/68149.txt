The New Constitution
The safe way Is to vote it down
There Is good In some of the amendments
but the bail greatly predominates
The best plan Is to cost your vote squarely
against the whole thing
The Constitution of 1817 was voted down
iy the people all but the judiciary article
The Constitution of 1804 ba features still
more objectionable I should b voted
down apportionment and all
