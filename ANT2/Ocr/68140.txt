THE VE 311 SIXS LEFT fOOT
A Toiinic Womnn or Observation Nnjr that
II Needs Very Hcrlaui Attention
ii I certainly would llketo know said ayoung
woman of observation why l Is that 00 per
cent of women turn In their left foot w lieu they
run up stairs If both feet were turned In I
could understand It but It I is only the left foot
that is I the offending member Iveoaked lots of
girls why they do itoh bless youi I do It my
selfand they have all denied the fblllng
but when a committee of Investigation
was appointed the verdict always wa that
the left foot was turned In and that It was
turned In at the toe Then when we rama to
Inquire Into the reason for this defect of gait It
seemed that nobody could furnish any that
would bear discussion Some said It must be
because of the pressure of the skirts but that
could not be because the skirt would affect
both feet alike Then too we tried running up
stairs with the skirts lifted free ot both feet but
It was no use the poor left foot remained
In dIsgrace and weakly continued to toe
in When We walked uu stairs with dignified
consciousness as wa should do if we knew we
were being watched fay some of you fellow
from below each foot kept straight but Im
mediately we started to run JM found that It
needed nil of our restraining care to keep thu
left toouie from pointing lu rig toe In the fucu
nf thus big too of I tlio right foot The general
verdict wa that It wa done naturally and
therefore uiiuin cloutl that wa were In fact
as Juck would say a hit of unbroken flllie all
having the common fault of Interfering with
hue near hind foot
Hut ns I have said none of tie could give
any iKcllie demonstrable reason for tills de
feet lu pro rett and Im very much Inclined to
uncut itner it for what tInt use of training
yourself to look hilts it cross between a ireet
goddess and oust of Du Maurleitsquureshoul

If iii try time you run up an American staIrcase
ou turn iii your left foot like a weakkneed
New Jersey heifer 1 It makes mo nod stud mail
to think of It and Ive been thinking a good
deal about It of late in a very chastened
frame of mind Thu only explanation I
ran give of this defect lu the great
and gorgeous creature that were growing
up to he I is I that its a cast of locumothe ate
simulbo i njlurul gait of us allut the old Eve
a wiimi us of rue oia Adamwa to walk with
the toe of both feet turued In toward each other
In a piliuitlt neighborly fashion In these dss
of the election of the dextrous we have con
quered the tendency to rmertlu tue right foot
but the old tendency linger in the neglected
left foot and betrays our tlmhin origin You
men lime succeeded 111 stamping the telltale
thing out amid we will too It only the great
uurldot women is aroutul to on upprwUtluu
of the gravity of this defect in our training
Now that its existence is I going to be toad
public I look of course fur the immediate cud
