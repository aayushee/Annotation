The Decision of the People
It Is I not necessary to exhort the citizens
of New York discharge the duty of voting
today The great registration approxi
mating closely the greatest which has ever
been made In New York Indicates that
the people are eager and determined t go to
the polls and that the vote cast before o
oclock this afternoon wilt b larger pro
portionately to the number qualified to exer
clue the franchise than ever before In the
history of this town
I Is admitted on all sides that the regis
tration is without fraud Suspicions
traton practically wihout Crald SI
picions to Its entire legality which may
have existed In ast years r now dis
missed OH groundless by the political
managers of every party Practically all
the men whose names appear on
the lists of every election district
are legally entitled t vote at its polling
place Thi possibilities of fraudulent vot
ing always grossly exaggerated have been
virtually eliminated this year No politi
cian of any party makes even the pretence
of taking them Into consideration
The election today accordingly will be 1
an absolutely and an indisputably honest
expression of the political sentiment of this
community so far on concerns candidates
for office and as the vote cast I likely
to b extraordinarily large proportionately
to the registration It will b the
fullest expression of that sentiment ever I
obtained New York The people do not
need to 0 driven to the polls They are all
patient t get thereof their own accord
and the same eagerness seems to prevail
throughout this State and the Union
Now let us see what they are going t do
t I evident that they have m do up their
minds with 1 tn determination which no
appeal now can change What that
decision Is I TiE Sm will tell tomor
row morning in voluminous and ex
lausllve return from every part of the
Union obtained with complete thorough
ness and clearly tabulated all presented In
exact and Impartial accordance with the
cold facts and the naked truth
