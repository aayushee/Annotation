DKNVKR Nov 111The Coroners Inquest over
tIme body of Klku Oyaroa the last of three fallen
women to be strangled began this afternoon
All day the crowd lingered In Market street
awaiting developments Thn women of the
street watch with the closest scrutiny every
strange face they see Theysgealt armed now
with revolvers knives and other means of do
fence
A sensation was created this afternoon bv the
appearance upon the scene of a clairvoyant
She refused to give her name She was under J
the escort of several detectives who took her to
the place of tIme last murder They entered the
adjoining house however In order to test the
abilities of this new detective When the women
of the street learned that aclalrvoyant was creo
sot they at once believed that now the guilty
men would be run to earth The clairvoyant
did not have any vision In the house she first
entered and asked to be taken away Then she
was ushered Into the right place where stand
ing In the middle of the room and without ap
pearing to enter the trance state she said she
saw a man with a light slouch hat and a sandy
drooping moustache Ills height she could not
determine He entered through tho lace cur
tain that hung In front of the door leading from
the parlor to the victims bedroom
He acted as If no were demented He as
saulted the woman and with remarkable dex
terity strangled her Then he rummaged the
bureau for a time and departed by the back
door carrying the key In his pocket
The clairvoyant wa then taken out through
the back door Into the yard and then Into the
alley She traced thu course of the murderer
Into the alleywhen she suddenly halted saying
Here he ran Into a man and I see him no
more
She gave many details as tothe conduct of the
man during his visit and departure He curried
a small bottle which ho threw u way upon leav
ing time house A detective produced a small
bottle which he said he had pltked up in the
yard It contained aconite
Tho clairvoyant added that another murder
would be committed oh the street and she
designated 11150 as the house number The
murderer carried his head a little to one side
and haunted time neighborhood constantly Ho
belonged lo tho class of people who Inhabited
the street and wan poorly dressed Time doteo
tlvei took the woman to Police Heodquarten to I
further question her t
The fact that three dissolute women have been
murdered by strangling In the same block In the
middle of the night within ten weeks is about j
all that Is known to time police The various
theories advanced as to who committed the
deeds or what the motives were are purely con I
Jeeturul It Is generally believed that the vic
tim were put out of the way by one and the j
same person Many prominent physicians be
hires tnut some mailman Is the slayer but It is I
asserted that this theory does not explain all the
points Involved In these cases
A woman ofthe row Is reported to have told a
strange story to a visitor last night fibs said i
that during the last two months n man who
claimed to be of ItalianFrench extraction has i
frequently visited the houses on the street I
Sometimes he appeared Inadress suit and again
he wore overalls and an old dilapidated coat Cl
over his finer clothing When he visited the I
houses frequented by the women of the foreign
quarter he appeared In the poorer costume but
he always dressed like a gentleman when he vA
Ited the inoruarlntocratlc places HMsdoscribed L
ai of dark complexion with small eyes and
long white fingers He Is said to be on intimate i
terms with the members of the French society I
which control the foreign women of the street
lie makes his visit unaccompanle 1 by anybody
He Is very excitable and seldom has anything to t
say about himself It Is I said that occasionally
he may be found In the saloon where the French i
men make their headquarters
