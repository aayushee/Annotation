The fire was In hold No 1 In which lucre warn
about 2800 bales of cotton TheHkldhy had
about 10000 bale aboard She had about con
eluded loading and would have cleared toinnr
row The fire had gained considerable hendw ay
when discovered
At 8115 It was found that there was fire lu Die
cotton In the hold of the steamer Baltimore
City at the Gordon Press Wharf about a mite
away from the Hkldby Alongside of this Haiti J
more City lay the steamer CaMlegarlh and a a few
minutes after the discovery of the fire on the
Baltlmoro City fire WM also discovered In this
forepeak of the Castlegarth In which compart
ment there were about 106 bales of cotton and
the seamens clotnes The hire on the Baltimore
City was bat small and was soon put out Un
the Castlegarth It was more obstinate and was
not extinguished until all the cotton In the com
partment was more or less damaged
About an hour lateY an alarm of fire was given
from the steamer Stag also loading at Gordons
wharf along with the Baltimore City and the
Castlegarth This fire proved to be the mot
obstinate of the three at the Gordon wharf and
It Is still burning
The Stag had on a large proportion of her
cargo Some 400 bales have been taken from a
her hold and the holds of the Baltimore
City and Castlegarth and put on light
ers About tho same time that the Stag
was reported afire nt Gordons wharf
fire started In the hold of the steamer
Delgarth at the Central Press Wharf
near the Skldby where the first fire occurred
and In a few minute the steamer Petunia alro
at the Central Press Wharf was reported with h
fire In her cotton The three shlt s afire at this
wharf were not over 300 yards apart
The three other ships afire were a mile awof
at tho other vdgoof the city The fire onth
Petunia was easily extinguished The Del
garths fire was extinguished when about 300
bales had been damaged
All of the fires are out now except those on
the Stag and Hktdby Loss as far as can be es
timated at this time Is about SoOOOO The
ships and the cargoes are covered by Insurance
As to the origin of the fires there Is no satisfac
tory explanation
In the case of the Stag a phosphorescent glow
was seen In her hold a few minutes before the
fire was discovered and it Is surmised that the
fire originated In this glow There has recently
been trouble among the longnhorvmen In this
city but them Is none now
Last spring the union longshoremen went
out on strike but recently great ninny of the
strikers have returned to work at the rates at
which the nonunion men were working
