Six cent postage for Domestic Letters
To THE EDITOR OF THE SUN Sir Not satisfied with
the income tax the Administration has formed a new 
plot the object of which is to increase further the 
amount of revenue While the scheme displays in
genuity it is too much like a flim flam game to find
favor with the long suffering people By putting a
thin non adhesive substance on the back side of the 
beautiful new sickly red postage stamp they first
save quite a sum on starch Secondly as the stamp
always comes off the letter in transmission they 
collect four cents more or double postage at the
other end Thus instead of two cents per letter as for
merly they now get sex cents This plan which from 
the number of complaints received at the Post office 
seems to be highly successful is a less odious tax than 
the income tax although to most of us it seems a little
off the square S A R
