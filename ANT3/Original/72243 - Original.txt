TACHERS TO BE RETIRED
300 Kindly Recommended for Decapitation
and About Twenty five to Go
Superintendent Jasper sent out on Nov 1 to
the Boards of Trustees and principals of gram
mar and primary school a circular on the retire
ment of teachers He quoted the law as follows
The Board of Education shall have power by a two 
third vote of all the members and after a recom
mendation to the effect shall have been made by the
City Superintendent of Schools stating that the 
teacher is mentally or physically incapacitated for the
performance of duty to retire any female teacher of
the grammar and primary schools n special
teachers in the same who shall have taught there in
during a period aggregating thirty years and to retire
any male teacher of said schools who shall have 
taught therein during period aggregating thirty five
years
Then the circular went one in order that I
may obtain all the facts which should guide me
making my recommendations to the Board of
Education I would ask from you a full report
upon each teacher who in your judgement
should be retired in conformity with the pro
visions of the act
These reports were to be sent in by Nov 15
and there are now lying upon the Superin
tendents desk reports containing the names of
about three hundred teachers who should be 
retired the Superintendent smiled knowingly
yesterday when asked if he didnt expect a good 
deal of trouble to come out of his circular
Well no he replied I do not expect much
trouble ofcourse there will be a great deal of 
backbiting but we dont mind that Someone 
will have to go and will have to go grace
fully You know we investigate thoroughly
every name sent into us for retirement so as not
to make a mistake
When asked how many would be retired the
Superintendent replied About twenty five 
will have to go most then women There
will be a good deal kicking done by those
who have not been thirty or thirty five years
in the business You see they will not get
a cent of pension Then some of the big teachers
will make a strong kick They will not enjoy
retiring on half pay We cant help it though 
If we decide to let a principal go go he will and
nothing will save him
