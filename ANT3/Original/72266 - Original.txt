FITCHS TERM EXTENDED 
Fellowss Too Apparently by the Revised 
Constitution 
The section of the new Constitution which 
seems to extend the term of Mayor elect Strong 
from two to three years is now interpreted as
prolonging the terms of Comptroller Fitch and 
District Attorney Fellows one year each so that t
heir successors will not take office until Jan 1 
1898 The new municipal article of the Const
itution makes this provision in section 4
All elections of city officers Including Supervisors
and judicial officers of inferior local courts elected in 
any city or part of a city and of county officers 
elected in the counties of New York and Kings and 
in all counties whose boundaries are the same as those 
of a city except to fill vacancies shall be held on the 
Tuesday succeeding the first Monday in November in
an odd numbered year and the term of every such 
officer shall expire at the end of an odd numbered 
year The terms of office of all such officers elected 
before Jan 1 1895 whose successors have not then 
been elected which under existing laws would expire 
with and even-numbered year or in an odd-numbered 
year and before the end thereof are extended to and 
including Dec 31 next following the time when such 
terms would otherwise expire the terms of 
office of all such officers which under ex
isting  laws would expire in an even-numbered year and 
before the end thereof are abridged so as to ex
pire at the end of the preceding year
The term for which Comptroller Fitch was elected 
would have expired at 12 oclock noon 
Jan 1 1897 but this provision extends it to 
Dec 31 of the same year District Attorney 
Fellows was elected last year for a term of three
years ending Dec 31 1896  His term is like
wise extended 
Comptroller Fitch said yesterday that he had 
been advised that his term has been extended 
by the new Constitution He said that he was 
of the opinion that District Attorney Fellowss 
term was also extended in like manner
The only question about the extention of the 
term of the District Attorney would arise under 
section 1 of Article X of the new Constitution 
which provides that in New York county the
Legislature may fix the term of the District At
troney at either two or four years With Col 
Fellowss term expressly extended in another 
part of the Constitution the question arises if 
the Legislature would have authority under Ar
ticle X to abridge it or only to legislate with
reference to the terms of his successors
