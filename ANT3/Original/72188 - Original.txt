SCHAEFER OUTPLAYS IVES
HE SHOWS THAT HE HASNT LOST
THE ART OF BALK LINE NURSING
He Makes one Tremendous Run of 244
and Backs It Up With Excellent Bil
liards Through the Evening Ives
Conldnt Reach the 200 Point but
Makes Some Exquisite Carroms The
Is 607 Ahead with Two Nights to Play
Dismal Indeed would have been the outlook
to most billiard stars who faced as did Wizard
Jacob Schaefer the score which he had to over
come the fourth night of the big six night bat
tle of the cues that he has been playing Frank
Ives thin young Napoleon of billiards In the
Madison Square Garden Concert Hall since
Monday night The youngster who has
ten years the better of him In youth was
718 points ahead of him and that in itself
would have been enough to discourage anybody
But it didnt appear to deject the little Wizard
a little bit Ives added but 6 to his unfinished
run of 43 proving again that it is almost impos
sible for a professions even with a favorable
position to jump In and play billiards right from
the start Schaefer buried the 6 with 28 and
the youngster came back at him with a break of
81 very pretty ones Schaefer made 2 and 6 and
Ives cracked two duck eggs
Then Schaefer began to shake out of his sleeve
the little trick business that be has received
credit with holding in reserve It was the art
of nursing in the corners and obviating the bar
that had been set up against such technical bil
liards by the abolition of the anchor shot The
Wizard fiddled away dexterously at this
business In his fourth Inning and then un
expectedly drove the globes out on the mid
table and coaxed them to the balk line Here
he began to handle them with that selfsame
dexterity that enabled him to swamp Vignaux
the French champion several years ago There
was nothing In all his play as beautiful as was
his stroke It his been often likened to that
poetry of motion exemplified by the play of a
fiddle bow In the hands of an expert violinist
No player alive has brought stroke to such a
perfection of easy grace All the time the car
roms were dropping thick and fast as he tapped
the globes Perfect position play lent its
lustrous charm to his work and won
plaudits that were oft repeated Thin wizard
passed his first century mark with ease
passed into his second century of count wiped
out his own previous great run of 230 with Vig
naux and still held control of the Ivories and
chased on to excel his own high run of 271
Across the cushion shot brought the run to an
untimely end at 244
The spectators sounded the loud trimbrel of
praise In honor of a beautiful run and the
Wizard sat down disappointed yet satisfied
He had come pretty near realizing the great
feat tint he had tried to attain In beating his
own record He had whittled off a big chunk of
Ives commanding lend and the scores went up
Schaefer 1262 Ives 1887
The Young Napoleon opened with a brilliant
masse when he walked to the table and fol
lowed It up with 16 carroms and Schaefer
stopped at 16 falling In the delicacy of his
play to get the balls out of balk This Is the re
sult almost invariably where the stalled
professional plays for results and for
gets the rules and the big stars al
ways do forget rules when playing for
great results Ives chewed his gum smiled for
for about the smallest fraction of a single second
and then walked to the table and put up some
of his stunning balk line nurse It was very
beautiful as usual and It kept the carroms
piling up swiftly He gained them on
tile balk line and they were corkers and
then he got them out in the midtable
and executed honey coolers ail being made
with the very greatest possible ease because he
had the secret of the science at his finger tips
There was a long huzzah when he reached his
century carrom and the spectators then leaned
over In silent anxiety to watch if he could reach
lie 200 point the youngster chewed away at
his gum and kept as it as if there was nothing
to worry about and knocked out some big bil
liards to prove it
A lot of them were open table efforts design
ed to gain position and at the same time to give
the spectator a taste of his prowess at open
work  He Kept the ivories dancing until
they had rung 177 and he went flying
around his second string with a total
for the night of 281 This put the total
scores Ives 2081 Schaefer 1378 Schaefer put
together 34 and youngsters went around his
third string in dandy style with a run of 19
With half the nights game ended both Were
tied at 330 points though the total scores
showed them still far apart with the Young
Napoleon away in the lead
Schaefer buckled down to business once more
and brought that puissant cue of his into ef
fective play and raced past the century score
Just as fast as his younger rival had done before
him He was making use of the nurse carroms
and doing it with exceeding skill and very showy
grace of stroke and he had the house with him
encouraging him to do bis best He ran 149 all
told which gave him the lead for the first time
on the nights play the scores for the evening
standing Schaefer 479 Ives 330
Ives fell back on his witchcraft of balk line
more to offset the Wizards advantage and he
got them going all right along the balk until an
unexpected miss cut him short at fifty nine
points where he ought to have gathered
in at least twice that number Th Wizard
came up as if nothing had happened and
showed that he knew the balk line nurse
and position play from a scientific standpoint
proving it alike by the rapidity accuracy and
Judgment of the carroms that he rattled off
with the greatest ease He missed because of
his speedy play at 62 points and saw the scores
go  up Schaefer 541 Ives 389 making a total
which was the only one displayed of 1623 to
2189
Then the Young Napoleon took a whack at it
and he did better than the Wizard A brilliant
bank shot at the outset when the cue ball was
frozen gave him a chance to win plaudits
which were frequently repeated in recognition
of his ability at nursing on the balk and In mid
table He reached and passed the Century mark
and yet the globes were lot to leave his cajoling
stroke He gathered 118 nearly reaching the
Wizards score being when he took this seat
34 points behind on a score for the night of 507
to Schaefer 541 The Wizard packed away
45 more to the good and the youngster got 22
and then got in some of his fine work and went 
out a winner on the nights score He
had the right however to keep agoing 
until he reached Ives big score if 
he could and therefore the spectators
who liked good billiards stayed right in their
seats and watched the carroms as they dropped
from his cue. They kept a coming quickly and 
were beautiful in execution all made at the out
set by balk line nursing of the best style IT was
neat work. very neat indeed and it resulted
profitably to the doughty little exemplar of the
art
Heart applause greeted his third century run
of the night and nerved him to keep it up until
a kiss a luckless one brought him to grass
He had made 697 to ives 532 and the grand
total stood Ives 2332 Schaefer 1779 He
had cut down the youngsters lead to 553 Ives
put up 58 and although it was not anywhere 
as effective as the Wizards play everybody in 
the hall knew that the game was over to all in
tent and purposes
A photographer lighted up the scene with a 
sudden flash light at this juncture and Ives as 
He did in Boston under similar unlooked for
circumstances missed He ran out the game in
the next inning though and the spectators
cheered The wizard had beaten him 111
points on the night play The  youngster still
held a huge lead 607 points n a total score of
2400 for four nights The score stands now
