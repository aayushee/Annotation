LITTLE SCALPERS OUTWITTED
They May No Longer Ply Their Business
at the Roosevelt Street Ferry
The superintendent of Roosevelt Street 
Ferry gave further evidence last night of his de
termination to stop the practice of selling tick
ets in front of the ferry house The new scheme
of the little scalpers to have customers toss
their commutation cards through the bars of 
the gates after the cards had been punched 
worked very well owning to an understanding
between the scalpers and their customers who
sympathized with them
This did not last long however for yesterday
morning a gang of carpenters started to work
boarding up the gates When the scalpers ar
rived all prepared for the evening rush they
were dismayed to find the gates boarded up
Well remarked one little scalper to his
companion dat super is a peach He ll build a
fence around de ferry house next The boys
stood in groups around the ferry house for a
while trying to devise some means to get the 
cards but they finally gave it up
The impression in ferry ticket scalping circles
is that the last move by the superintendent is a 
knock out blow to the business There was 
some talk by the scalpers of having customer
toss the card through the small opening at the
top of the gates but this is hardly possible as
the space s only about a foot high and is fully
fifteen feet from the ground
