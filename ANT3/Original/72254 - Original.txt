TRAFFIC ON THE ELEVATED ROADS
Increased facilities on the Surface Roads
Have Attracted Passengers
The publication of the report of the Third Av
enue Railroad Company for the year ending
Oct 31 and that of the Manhattan Railway
Company for the year ending Sept 30 makes It
possible to compare the business of the two
systems for nearly the same period The Man
hattan Company shows a loss In gross earnings
in its fiscal year as compared with the twelve
months previous of nearly $1000000 The
Third Avenue Railroad Company on the other
hand shows a gain over the business of the pre
vious fiscal year of $354255 on a total busi
ness only onefifth as large as the Manhattan
Company
The latter company on Its lines In the city lost
23789363 passengers and a very large propor
tion of this loss is accounted for in the increased
earnings of the surface lines The extension of
the transfer system above Fiftyninth street by
the Metropolitan Traction Company and the
extension the Sixth avenue line of cars to and
along Amsterdam avenue has taken a large
amount of traffic from the Sixth avenue and
Ninth avenue lines of the elevated road
The surface road under the elevated struc
ture on Columbus avenue and connecting
with the Broadway cable road has also carried
a great deal of traffic that formerly went by the
elevated road Since the opening of these two
routes the transfer business has been largely
increased
The stockholders meeting of the Thirty
fourth street railway adjourned yesterday until
Nov 29 without electing new officers The Sec
retary of the company said that the line through
Thirtyfourth street from Sixth to Lexington
avenue will be completed and in operation the
latter part of next week
