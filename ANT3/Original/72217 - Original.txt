Tiger Hunters Beware the Elephant
To THE EDITOR of THE SUN Sir I notice
that the reformers In your great city are still
fighting the tiger which is very unsportsman
like badgering a dead animal for according to
their own accounts the tiger is dead I take
the opportunity of Inviting their attention to
the elephant which Is now claiming their atten
tion and beg assure them as an old menag
erie manager that they will find this new animal
a good deal harder to manage themselves if not
That prince of showmen Mr Barnum once
said that he would rather have a dozen tigers on
his hands than one elephant Therefore the
sooner the new keepers turn to the very large ele
phant which is thus far calmly demanding
their attention time better for themselves if not
for time elephant
