If Governor ELIAS CARR should call a ses
sion of the present North Carolina Legislature
Democratic for the purpose of electing a suc
cessor to the Hon THOMAS JEFFERSON JARVIS
Senator In Congress by appointment he would
rouse a horrible tempest among the Republicans
and Populists who are expecting to divide the
two Senatorships between them in the next
Legislature Governor CARR might well be
the man himself He is able and honest
and from the aesthetic point of view he Is
sublime his moustachios being regarded bf
travellers foreign and domestic as the noblest
piece of capillary scenery In the world In the
Senate he would be sure to have a chastening
Influence on PEFFER and even the relentless 
STEWART might scale down his l6 1 whiskers
