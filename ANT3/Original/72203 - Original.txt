Merchants That Dont Understand
Their Own Business
There is a thing which it seems to us de
serves the attention of those grocery store
keepers who are afraid that they will be
ruined by the department stores at which
groceries well as dry goods and other wares
are kept for sale They must have noticed
while perusing THE SCNs pages day after
day that the most successful dry goods
anti furnishing houses including those
of them that have a grocery annex
take pains to make their business
known to the community by advertising it
largely In these advertisements they spec
ify the goods which they offer for sale from
time to time in the year amid often give the
prices of them and always tell of particular
bargains which are to be obtained They do
so In captivating language and In attractive
typography They know by experience that
It pays to do this that thus customers are
drawn to their establishments anti good
sales are made anti profits are taken In
By obtaining their confidence one may as
certain the results of their advertising and
we think that some of the grocers would be
surprised to learn of them An enterpris
ing firm which advertised a special line of
goods In this paper one day of last week was
out of stock In that line before nightfall of
the day
It is surprising how few of the grocery
houses of the city take advantage of this
means of making their goods known widely
and drawing customers and enlarging their
business and making It more profit
able Why are they so obtuse  Why
so negligent of their own interests 
Why so unwilling to follow the example
set them by men in other branches
of business  They must have observed
while examining The SUNS advertising
pages that the leading department houses
which have a grocery annex are wise
enough to make the fact known and some
times to advertise time prices at which
groceries can be procured from them
How does it happen that these people
are so much shrewder than most of the
grocers who deal only In groceries They
will certainly get the advantage of their
rivals In the grocery trade If these rivals do
not wake up THE SUNS advertising col
umns are open to shopkeepers In every
branch of honest business and to all other
honest people who have use for them
Stir your stumps grocers  or you will all
be annexed as departments of other estab
lishments the proprietors of which have
brains to spare
