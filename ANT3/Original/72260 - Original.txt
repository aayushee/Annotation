HICHBORNS PAPER
Steel Ships Must Be Sheathed to Be Kept 
in Service
Chief Constructor Philip Hichborn of the navy 
will read a paper today upon the care and 
preservation of our new steel ships Mr
Hichborns paper says that the mod
ern was vessel is a piece of exceedingly 
delicate mechanism and that the rapid 
deterioration of even its stationary parts can 
only be circumvented by ceaseless caution and 
constant attention to minute details The popu
lar impression that a new ship does not require 
repairs is quickly demolished when the quali
ties and functions of one of the three modern 
battleships the Indiana the Massachusetts 
or Oregon are considered The size of such 
a vessel is equal to a cube whose side is about 85 
feet In this space 500 men must eat live and 
sleep It also contains 1600 tons of coal 
and enormous machinery for driving the 
ship There are fortyfour guns ranging from 
13inch rifles with their halfton projectiles to 
the six millimetre Gatlings Tons upon tons 
of ammunition for all these weapons must 
be carried in the quantities to provide for
a prolonged fight The enormous protec
tive armor enters into the calculation 
and the structure which supports all these
weights and provides all these accommodations 
must be subdivided into small compartments 
which in turn must be constantly supplied with 
fresh air and be capable of being pumped out 
The wear and tear of such complicated struc
ture is evidently rapid and it is only by the 
stitch in time that it can be maintained 
readiness for active service 
The fouling of a vessels bottom is an expen
sive matter and it is intimately connected with 
the ship’s fighting efficiency 
The only remedy for this is to sheath ships 
European nations are sheathing their war ves
sels with wood and copper American ships 
must be sheathed 
The United States has but seven Govern
ment docks none of which will receive 
the battle ships With the exception of 
one at Halifax there is no other dock in
the western hemisphere that will hold the bat
tle ships In time of war the embarrassment 
would be serious as frequent docking is re
quired to keep steel ships in efficient condition 
while sheathed ships need not be docked for 
year at a time
