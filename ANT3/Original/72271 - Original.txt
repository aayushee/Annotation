WAS IT A MKANE JOKE 
Expert brown finds only a toy 
boat in gravesends safe
Mr Brown Had Gone to Sing Sing and per
suaded the ex-Chief to sign a paper per
mitting the Opening of the Safe-Had 
It Carted from Gravesend to Brooklyn
Several times during his career as boss of 
Gravesend John Y McKane showed signs of 
latent humour Occasional flashes of wit and 
now and then a little practical joke convinced 
the great mans faithful constituents that his 
bump of humour was not entirely undeveloped 
It was supposed however that his confinement 
in prison and the loss of his luxuriant mous
tache had dammed the stream of wit in his 
vein But they havent as has been demon
strated by the experience of Accountant Will
iam A Brown of the Auditors office of Brook
lyn and other city officials who have been help
ing Mr Brown to find out the exact condition of 
affairs in Gravesend Mr Brown decided that 
he could do nothing without the Gravesend 
books and papers
On Monday last he went to Sing Sing and saw 
McKane who said that the only reason he had
not given up the town books and papers was be
cause he was afraid that whoever conducted the 
investigation would not give him a fair show 
He assured Mr Brown that the accounts were 
all right and said that the books would prove 
that there was no shortage If he really thought 
that he would get a square deal he said he 
would sign an order on some friends for the 
books and papers and let Mr Brown have them MC
Brown promised that he would see that Mc
Kane was treated fairly and McKane told Mr 
Brown that he would find everything in the big 
safe in the Town Hall at Gravesend McKane 
signed a paper expressing his willingness to 
have the contents of this safe which is said to
be his private property examined
Mr Brown went down to Gravesend on Tues
day with a big truck and a gang of men After 
about four hours of hard work the men got the 
safe on the truck and started for Brooklyn with 
it But the roads were rough and the distance 
long and it was Wednesday morning before the 
combined efforts of half a dozen horses and 
twice as many men got the wagon and it prec
ious load in front of the Municipal building in 
Brooklyn When the truck pulled up however 
there on the steps of the building stood Mr
 Brown almost all of the attaches of the Asse
ssors office and any number of citizens attracted 
by the lettering on the face of the safe Mr 
Brown and both declared that it was an ex
ceedingly clever idea to wait until they got the 
safe into the Municipal building before open
ing it 
The safe was moved into the corridor of the 
Municipal building after much labour The Jan
itor guarded it after the building was closed on 
Wednesday afternoon Yesterday morning 
when Mr Brown pale with excitement walked 
into the corridor the janitor was still there and 
the citys accountant heard a sigh of relief when 
he saw the safe there too Chains enough to 
have held a house suspended in mid-air were put
in place It took two hours to complete the
preparations to hoist the safe to the
Assessors office on the third floor and
a big crowd gathered in the balconies to
watch the operation The people cheered when
the famous safe was finally swung safely to the
third balcony and wheeled into the Assessors
office Mr Brown and Mr Harkness clasped
hands and the clerks grinned Then Mr Brown
remembered that he didnt have the combina
tion and off he rushed to the office of one of the
former Gravesend assessors at Court street
Mr Brown hurried back to the Municipal
building with the combination on a bit of paper
and Clerk McMahon opened the doors of the
safe It was empty Mr Brown turned pale
Mr Harkness looked faint and the clerks
snickered Nothing was said by anybody Mr
Brown put his hand in the safe and hauled out a
little toy boat made of brass Mr Brown and
Mr Harkness groaned in unison Mr Brown
insists that McKane did not know that the safe
was empty when he gave Mr Brown permission
to have it examined and hopes yet to get the
books and papers from some one of the ex bosss
friends Others who recall the propensity for
jokes which occasionally overcame McKane in
his palmy day simply smile
