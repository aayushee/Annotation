Citizens of Cleveland have been requested
by the Chamber of Commerce not to put O
or Ohio on their letter head or after
their names when they Inscribs them on n
hotel register This request Is not made
to Show regret for being In Ohio but to
express the fact and belief that Cleveland
is so great anti famous that all the
world takes geographical notice of It Certainly
Cleveland Is big enough to be accepted without
further proof of Identification and we dare say
the time will be when such persons from Ohio
as are not employed at Washington will be glad
to hail from Ohio Cleveland
