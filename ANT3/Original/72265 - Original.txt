PARKHURST ON BYRNES  
He Doesn’t Seem to Be Satisfied at All
With the Head Policeman
Senator Lexow Chairman of the Senate In
vestigating Committee expressed surprise yes
terday at statements reported to have been made
by the junior counsel to the committee that 
legislation for a total reorganization of the Police 
Department would be the result of the commit
tees investigation Mr Lexow remarked that 
the testimony was not all in yet and that 
the committee has not decided what legislation to 
recommend 
Dr Parkhurst made at Lakewood yesterday 
these remarks about Superintendent Byrnes
My experience with the Police Department
and more especially with Superintendent 
Byrnes during the past three years has proved 
to me that as a moral factor no man more per
fectly or more ingeniously than he embodies the 
spirit which makes the Police Department the
vicious and conscienceless thing that it is He
has been the executive head of the department 
during most of that time and it is under him 
that it has reached the acme of undisciplined and 
knavery that has been demonstrated to chara
cterize it When De Lancey Nicoll who is 
Byrness bosom friend was in power they tried 
their best to have me combine with the 
Superintendent to pound the Captains but it 
has been a principle from which I have 
not swerved to form no alliance with such 
as I felt themselves to be under suspicion 
There is no denying the fact that Byrnes did 
good service on Election Day and I have publicly 
commented on that but why if he could pre
vent illegal voting and fraud this year did he 
not do so in previous years Byrnes has done 
just enough good work when it served his 
purpose so to do to show his but has been 
sufficiently chary in the exercise of that capacity 
to convict himself either of indifference or of
criminality
Dr Parkhurst said further that the testi
mony before the Lexow Committee had dem
onstrated that Superintendent Byrnes was
the practical head of the department and in full 
control He should have suppressed the green 
goods business and the abortion business and 
if he did not know that such crimes were being 
committed he was not fit to be at the head
Dr Parkhurst adds that the Police Depart
ment should be divorced from the Bureau of 
Elections entirely The Police Department or 
force proper should be entirely under the con
trol of one man who should be immediately
responsible to the Mayor
When asked if he believed Superintendent 
Byrnes would resign from the head of the Police 
Department Dr Parkhurst said No not until
he is in some way compelled to do so
The Council of the Confederated Good Gov
ernment clubs has adopted resolutions praising 
the work of the police on election day and com
mending Superintendent Byrnes for the sincere 
and earnest support he and other members of 
the force gave the G G watchers
