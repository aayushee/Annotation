The illustrious Arab takes a car and not a
camel when he goes to eat salt in memory of the 
illustrious Sogdianan But the glamour of
the East goes with him and one eyed
calenders crowd the platform of the 
imagination and HAROUN AL RACHID slum
ming with the Grand Vizer drives 
the car The barbers seventh son
recommends a little tonic and Zobeide waits
upon the table Hail to the Knights of Mys
tic Shrine of Richmond Our grief for the de
cease of AFGERGANEC has been somewhat miti
gated by time but we hope the memorial ban
quet last night was no Barmecide outfit
