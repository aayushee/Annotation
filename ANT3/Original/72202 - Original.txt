A Question Easily Answered by An
other Question
The opposition of our esteemed contem
porary the New York Herald to the Popu
list Income tax was constant and consistent
I list patriotic journals had done their duty
as the Herald did Its duty the result in
Congress might have been different
Concerning the Presidents responsibility
for the Democratic defeat of last week the
herald now ask this question
Was It not Mr CLEVELAND who wrote to Chairman
WILSON during the tariff agitation last summer You
know how much I deprecated the incorporation In
the proposed bill of the Income tax feature 
We reply Yes It was Mr CLEVELAND
who wrote to Mr WILSON I last summer
after the Populist measure had been welded
firmly Into the Tariff bill You know how
much I deprecated the Incorporation In the
proposed bill of the Income tax feature
And Mr WILSON knew exactly how much
Mr CLEVELAND had deprecated the incor
poration of that odious socialistic measure
Everybody else In the country knew too
Was it not Mr CLEVELAND who wrote to
the Fifty third Congress last winter before
any other Democrat dared to advocate open
ly the Incorporation of an Income tax In the
Tariff bill The committee Mr WILSONS
Committee of Ways and Means have wisely 
embraced In their plan a few additional In
ternal revenue taxes Including a small tax
upon Incomes derived from certain corpo
rate investments These new assessments
are absolutely just and easily borne
That initial recommendation of the Income
tax by Mr CLEVELAND fastened the odious
socialistic measure upon the people of this
country and that paragraph In Mr CLEVE
LANDS message written seven months before
the dishonest letter to WILSON from which
the Herald quotes measures the extent to
which Mr CLEVELAND deprecated the incor
poration of an income tax in the Tariff bill
