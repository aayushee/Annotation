Chief Constructor Philip Hlchborn the nay
will read a paper today upon the care and
preservation of our new steel ships Mr
Itlchborns paper says that the mod
ern war vessel Is a piece of exceedingly
delicate mechanism and that the rapid
deterioration of even Its stationary parts can
only be circumvented by ceaneless caution arid
constant attention to minute drlnlls The popu
lar tmpressslon that a new ship does not require
repairs Is quickly demolished when the quali
ties and functions of one of the three modern
battleships the Indiana the Massachusetts or
Oregon are considered The size of such a
slells equal to a cube whose side Is I about Sf
feet In this space 800 men must eat live and
sleep 1 also contains 1000 tons of cost
and enormous machinery for driving the
ship There are forlyfour guns ranging from
IHlncli rifle with their halfton projectiles tn
the six millimetre fallings Tons upon tons
of ammunition for all these weapons must
be carried III quantities to provide for
1 prolonged fight The enormous protec
tive armor enters Into the calculation
and the structure which supports 1 these
weights and nrovliles all the accommodations
must be subdivided Into small compartments
which III turn must be constantly supplied with
fresh air and be capable of being pumped wih
The wear and tear of such complicated limo
turn Is I evidently ranld and It Is I only by th
stitch in time that It ran be maintained In
readiness for active service
The fouling of 1 vessels bottom Is an expen
sive mutter And It Is Intimately connected with
the ships tlghtliii efficiency
The nnlr remedy for this Is I to sheath ships
European nation arc sheathing their war ves
sels with WIKH and copper American ships
must b sheathed COller
The United States has but seven Govern
ment docks none of which will receive
the battle ships With the exception of
one at Halifax there I no other dock In
the western hemisphere that will hold the bat
tie ship In time of war the embarrassment
would be serious as frequent docking Is re
quired tn keep steel ships In efllclent condition
while sheathed ships need not h docked for
years at a time
