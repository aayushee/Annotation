Merchants That DOlt Understand
Their Own llnslncs1
There is n thing which It seems to u de
serves the attention of those groccrystoro
keepers who are afraid that they will be
ruined by the department stores at which
groceries well as dry goods and other wares
are kept for sale They must have noticed
while perusing THE SCNa pages day after
day that the most successful dry goods
anti furnishing houses Including those
of them that have n grocery annex
tnko pains to make their business
known to the community by advertising it
largely In these advertisements they spec
Ify the goods which they offer for wile from
time to time in the year amid often give the
prices of them and always tell of particular
bargains which are to b obtained They do
so In captivating language and In attractive
typography They know by experience that
It pays to no tills that thus customers are
drawn to their establishments anti good
sales are made anti profits nre taken In
By obtaining their confidence one may as
certain the results of their advertising and

the day
It is surprising how few of the grocery
houses of the city take advantage of this
means of making tholr goods known widely
and drawing customers anti enlarging their
business nnd making It more profit

while examining Tit SUNS advertising
pages that the leading department houses
which have I grocery annex sure wise

times to advertise time prices nt which

are KO much shrewder than most of the
grocers who del only In groceries They
will certainly get the advantage of their
rivals In the grocery trade If these rivals do
