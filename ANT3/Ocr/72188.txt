to most billiard stars who faced as did Wizard
Jivob Schaefer tha score which he had to over

tle of the cues that he has been playing Frank
Ives thin young Napoleon of billiards In the
Madison Square Harden Concert Hall since
Moiday night The youngster xrho lint

n little bit Ixesadded but 0 to his unfinished
run of 41 proving again that It Is almost Impos
sible for a professions ex en with n favorable
position to jump In and play billiards right from
the start Schaefer burliil the 0 with UH and
the youngster clime hack at him with n break of
81 cry pretty ones Schaefer macto U nnd ii and
Ixes tracked two duck eggs
Then Schacfer began shake out of his sleeve
tho little trick business that be his rccclxcd
credit with holding In reserve It xxas tho art
of nursing In the corners and obviating the bar
that had been l set up against such technical hi
lltxrdsby the abolition of the anchor shot The
Wizard fiddled away dexterously at this
business In his fourth Inning and then un
expectedly droxe the globes out on tile mid
Uble and conieil them to the balk line Here
ho began to handle them xxlth that selfsame
dexterity that enabled him to swamp Vlgnaux
the French champion several J cars ago There
was nothing In all his play as beautiful as xxas
his stroke It his been often likened to that
poetry of motion etempllfieil by tho play of a
llddle now In the hands of an expert iollnlst
No placer alit has brought stroke to such a
perfection of easy grace All the time the car
roms lucre dropping thick nnd fast ns he topped
the globes Perfect position play lent Its
lustrous charm to Ills stork and xxon
plaudits that were oft repeated Thin xxlrard

The spectators sntinded the loud trimbrel of
praise In honor of a beautiful run and the
