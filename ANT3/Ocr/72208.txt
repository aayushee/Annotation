I Is due to the art of Missouri to say that
among the Innumerable pictorial roster that
crowed and roosted In the morning and evening
and weekly papers of that State the fowls exhibited
ted by the lon 1 I McCutrAGlt were
the handtomest sleekest best fed and
presumably time clearest throated They
aN reproductions of Mr McCiMAons own
fowls fortunate birds that feed on hulled corn
and cream and drink lienedictlne Their diet
gives a peculiar richness to their plumage a
luxuriance to their wattles and 1 haunting
sweetness to their craw
