We make much said n travelled Xew
Yorker of the sudden transition to bo had by I
turning In from the roar of the Btramth in Lon j
don to the quIet of the Temple llaulen but
there are Just as great changes to be had right
here In Now York city What greater change I
can there be than that tn ho maul by slipping
down Twenljflm street from Hroadway lo
Oramercy lark It Is to pass from the feverish
rush and rattle of the metropolis to the sober 1
sedaleneis and pteatanl quiet of some oldfaili
loned country town t was a good deal worried
yesterday and t tried the experiment of Inking
n halt hour dose of liratnerry lark It was the
bestsnlatlte ou csn Imnslnt
The houses stood steeped In hut rare N em
ber sunshine with scarcely a sign of llfo to
tusk hi upon their air of comfnrltblo drowsi
ness an old butler was leading an old and pur
blind dog slowly along the wnrmet sidewalk
In the enclosure were three maids watching as
many children taking an mienMr siesta In
whlto noits on wheel and a gardener raking
Uu the dead leaves with the gentle rustle that
carried mo right back lo milling tlae In the
woods tip In the Mohawk Valley And that
was nit the life there was In tho picture The
roaring stream that flowed and ebbtd at
tine same time on Droidway might IIAAC
beenn hundred miles off nand t walked back to
plunge Into It aitatn with n nrn tock of strength
and spirit I had been nnavfnimlt onlylmlf
au hour but It nccincd rs though I had hrcn
spending n week In timer nnd retlrumpiit It wns
like the refreshment that comes from forty
winks when jnnrodead tired
It I did I me gHxl Htid It would do all of us
good If wo ii ire to take such a lnouituhufllhnit dose
ofiiulet otmco antI again Itcinl be melts man
aged too for tlranifrcj lark Is not tin1 only quiet
turnlneIn place tn New York by anv mciinii
Theres Stu usnnt square for Instance one of
the prettiest spots tn Now York and I wn
going to say one of the least vMted Half n
block from the clangor of Third avenue It I as
retired as If It were a mile from it hen I too
you can only look In on Uramcrcv Park while
In Ktuyvcsnnt tho great Iron gates In the grand
old Iron railing swing open freely for the public
which Ignores it llo thorn when you will xnd
the benches under the big tires are ncer
crowded and you ran mcdltcto as unlntcrrupt
illy as In a country chutch ard Sit them
facing Rutherford plniv with your feet
In a Utter of leaesand joti will get an archi
tectural peep that tourist would flock to see If
It were three thousand mile across the Atlan
tic Tn tho right Is tao Imiioslng though unfin
ished facade of St tleorges n nriiv rIch In color
with a blazo of Virginia creeper To tho left

of tine Uuakers set In their trim nnd pretty
lawns while tine towering cumpanllo of the St
