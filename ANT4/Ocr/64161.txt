SAVANXAU Ga Nor Savannah II In a
Mate of nervous apprehension It was not until
noon today that the full extent of the efforts to
linn the water front of the city with burning
vessels and wharves was reallted Investiga
tion then disclosed the fact that a combination
of chemicals of which phosphorous was a prom
Inent element had been placed In the holds of
thirteen foreign steamships loading with cot
ton and had been placed on cotton on the
wharves to fire It On nine of the iteanuLIu
the compound did Its stork effectively
The IJrltlsti steamer County Donn was the
last one to suffer fire being discovered on board
at 7 oclock this morning The Fire Depart
ment put It out and the damage was confined
to a few bates In one of the hold On some
other cotton in this vessel the chemical com
pound mid by tIme incendiarIes was discovered
The llrltlsh steamer WhUfleld was found tn
be mi fire about II I oclock this morning It had
suffered from n prior tire about 1 3 oclock III the
morning Tho later fire wits In a hold entirely
rut oil from tin hold tat which the lust one
occurred Tho other steamers which are now
being surv ed onaccountof theflresdlscoverrd
on them are the UJbj J Itnlllmoie City Ciitle
Kalth Stag Dvlcgarth Ieluma and Armenia
The Skldby suffered Beverly her deck plates be
ing red hot at times and her sides badly
scorched Fifteen feet of water are In her two
aft holds In which there are 7000 bales of cot
ton
At a special meeting of time City Council this
afternoon a toward of 300 for the arrest of
each of the Incendiaries was offered Amass
meeting nf citizens wilt bo held tn a day or two
It Is believed that there were about twenty men
If not more lathe plot tu destroy all the cotton
hips
Everybody believes the negro union long
shoremen are at the bottom of the mischief
Nonunion men are working on the ships this
year At tht beginning of the season there was
a small riot In which several men were shot
The determined stand taken by the authorities
soon stopped the disorder
About ten days ago a number of the union
negroes offered to go to work Their services
were accepted and they were scattered among
the ships It Is I plainly the belief that this wan
a ruse by some of them to get an opportunity
to tire the vessels A diagram Is being pre
pared showing tint location of each union
man working on tine ships It Is believed that
the object aimed at In firing the ships was not
sn much to destroy the vessels as tn terrorize
shipowners and lead them to refuse to send
ve sels here thus aiming a blow at the ship
brokers and the business of time port that would
force tho brokers tn come to term
The fact that the fires with one exception
were discovered before they lind maile much
liendray alone presented the scheme from lie
log successfnl The loss but for clrcutustam
u bleb the Incendiaries could not control might
easily inse run well up Into the millions
During the course of the fIre at the upper
compresses some cotton was handed to a police
man The policeman rubbed the cotton slightly
and this set It ablaze On two or three of the
burning vessel the odor of phosphorus was very
strong On some bales of cotton the ties when
rubbed gave out a flash of flame showing that
some chemical had been scattered about that
friction or heat Ignited It Is believed this stuff
was scattered In the vessels esterday afternoon
probably between noon and knocklngoff
time
This morning all of the watchmen on the ca
sein were arrested many of them having been
union longshoremen They were subsequently
discharged Tonight hue wharves are being
closely guarded by the police and special watch
men IIo e In laid and cverj thing IK In readiness
In the event that any more tires should break
out Several small cotton Ores on the wharves
today led to time discovery that the comiwund
lienni l by the Incendiaries In essels was sent hero
from New Orleans
